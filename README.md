Repository to document my journey while I try to learn Python with the end goal of using the language to create a simple but fun 2D rougelike game. This repo will act as the hub for all Python files that I create while I learn the language up until I finish the game. The guide I will be using as learning material is from this site: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp. For the game, I will be following this tutorial: https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/.
