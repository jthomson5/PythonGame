Repository to document my journey while I try to learn Python with the end goal of using the language to create a simple but fun 2D rougelike game. This repo will act as the hub for all Python files that I create while I learn the language up until I finish the game. The guide I will be using as learning material is from this site: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp. For the game, I will be following this tutorial: https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/. The TestFolder contains the code I wrote while learning the different parts of the language and the GameFolder contains the code for the rougelike game. Running testRun.py in the GameFolder should run the game (Python3 and tcod needed)!
