Repository to document my journey while I try to learn Python with the end goal of using the language to create a simple but fun 2D rougelike game. This repo will act as the hub for all python files that I create while I learn the language up until I finish the game. Guide I will be using as learning material is this site: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp.
